  <h2 class="section-title">How TruCite Works</h2>

  <div class="bp-card bright-card">
    <h3>1. Output Interception</h3>
    <p>
      TruCite integrates downstream of LLMs, RAG systems, and AI agents,
      evaluating generated output before it enters enterprise workflows.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="bp-card bright-card">
    <h3>2. Structural Reliability Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      TruCite analyzes linguistic certainty, numeric claims, volatility signals,
      internal consistency, and evidence presence to assess structural reliability.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="bp-card bright-card">
    <h3>3. Policy-Based Decisioning</h3>
    <p>
      Reliability signals are evaluated against enterprise policy rules to produce
      a machine-enforceable decision: <strong>ALLOW / REVIEW / BLOCK</strong>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="bp-card bright-card">
    <h3>4. Enforcement Signal + Audit Fingerprint</h3>
    <p>
      TruCite returns both a structured decision signal for downstream systems

  <!-- ⭐ A MISSING LAYER IN THE AI STACK -->
  <section id="missing-layer" class="blueprint-section">
    <h2 class="section-title">A Missing Layer in the AI Stack</h2>
    <div class="bp-card bright-card">
    <p>
  As AI systems become embedded into enterprise workflows, a new control layer is emerging between model output and system action.
  TruCite represents this category: <strong>independent reliability scoring and policy-based decision gating for AI-generated content.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  This layer does not replace models, guardrails, or monitoring systems — it determines whether AI output is sufficiently reliable to enter operational or automated pathways.
  Downstream execution and identity systems then use TruCite’s decision signal to bind authorization and accountability.
</p>

<p>
  TruCite is designed as a model-agnostic, API-first infrastructure component that integrates downstream of LLMs and agents, providing enterprise-grade scoring, <strong>ALLOW / REVIEW / BLOCK</strong> decisions, and audit-ready output fingerprints.

        TruCite is designed as language-agnostic reliability infrastructure. While the MVP emphasizes

      <p>
        In healthcare, legal, government, and financial workflows, critical decisions often occur in

        <summary>How is TruCite different from OpenEvidence?</summary>
        <div class="acc-body">
          OpenEvidence and similar tools focus on <strong>retrieval and citations</strong>.
          TruCite is a <strong>verification and policy layer</strong>: it scores the output itself and returns
          an enforceable gate action that downstream systems can use to control AI-driven workflows.

      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>If our data pipeline is secure and governed, why do we still need TruCite?</summary>
        <div class="acc-body">
          Secure data and governance ensure trusted inputs. But LLMs and agents transform that data into newly generated output,
          and that generation step introduces risk: hallucinated facts, overconfident language, misapplied guidelines, and
          reasoning errors — even with perfect source documents.
          <br /><br />
          TruCite covers the post-generation risk layer by scoring output reliability and issuing a machine-enforceable decision
          (ALLOW / REVIEW / BLOCK) plus an audit fingerprint for compliance, logging, and downstream enforcement.

      <details>
  <summary>Does TruCite handle execution governance or authorization?</summary>
  <div class="acc-body">
    TruCite focuses on output reliability and decision governance.
    It determines whether AI-generated output is safe to act on and returns
    a machine-enforceable decision signal.
    <br /><br />
    Execution governance — including identity binding, authorization, and workflow control —
    is handled by downstream orchestration or enterprise systems that consume TruCite’s decision output.

        <summary>Is this just “AI correcting AI”? Isn’t that risky?</summary>
        <div class="acc-body">
          TruCite does not replace your models or generate new content. It operates as an independent scoring and
          <strong>policy enforcement layer</strong> that supports human oversight and system-level safeguards.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How is TruCite future-proof if models keep changing?</summary>
        <div class="acc-body">
          TruCite is model-agnostic. It focuses on output integrity and risk signals rather than internal vendor confidence scores.
          This allows TruCite to function as a stable verification and enforcement layer even as underlying models evolve.
        </div>
      </details>

      <!-- NEW: Multilingual FAQ -->
      <details>
  <summary>Does TruCite support non-English or regional languages?</summary>
  <div class="acc-body">
    TruCite is designed as language-agnostic reliability infrastructure. The MVP demo emphasizes
    English-first signal analysis, while enterprise deployments extend verification through modular
    multilingual signal libraries tailored to regional and regulatory contexts.
    <br /><br />
    Structural risk signals — including numeric claims, certainty patterns, and volatile real-world facts —
    are evaluated independently of model vendor or language. This allows TruCite to apply consistent
    <strong>ALLOW / REVIEW / BLOCK</strong> policy decisions across global and regional-language AI deployments.
    <br /><br />
    Planned enterprise enhancements include multilingual evidence parsing, language-aware volatility detection,
    and country-specific policy profiles aligned with local compliance standards.

      <details>
        <summary>Does TruCite store my content?</summary>
        <div class="acc-body">
          In this public MVP demo, no. Enterprise deployments can support encrypted audit trails under strict retention controls.

    <div class="accordion">
      <details>
        <summary>Read story</summary>
        <div class="acc-body">
          TruCite was founded by <strong>Mani Subramanian, MD, MMI</strong> — physician executive,
          clinical informatics architect, and technology strategist — to solve a growing enterprise problem:
          AI systems can now generate guidance and decisions at scale, but organizations lack an
          independent layer to determine whether those outputs are safe to trust.
          <br /><br />
          After years leading clinical informatics transformation, EHR modernization, and
          technology-driven care redesign, Mani saw how small inaccuracies in high-stakes
          environments — healthcare, legal, financial — can cascade into real-world harm.
          <br /><br />
          TruCite was created to be that missing layer:
          <strong>independent AI output risk infrastructure</strong> that evaluates reliability,
          produces audit-ready risk signals, and issues a machine-enforceable decision
          (ALLOW / REVIEW / BLOCK) that enterprise systems can use to control AI-driven workflows.
          <br /><br />
          The vision is not to replace AI systems — but to make them deployable in
          environments where accountability, auditability, and safety are required.
