  <p class="hero-tagline">Runtime Execution Reliability Control Plane for AI Systems</p>

  <p class="hero-subtitle hero-subtitle-tight">
    TruCite is a <strong>model-agnostic runtime execution reliability control plane</strong> that assigns a deterministic risk score to AI output before it triggers downstream action — issuing a machine-enforceable <strong>ALLOW / REVIEW / BLOCK</strong> decision with an execution-bound audit fingerprint.
  </p>

  <p class="hero-subtitle hero-subtitle-tight">
    Architecturally independent of model vendors, orchestration layers, and security gateways, TruCite provides a neutral reliability signal across heterogeneous AI stacks.
  </p>

  <p class="hero-subtitle hero-subtitle-tight">
    As AI systems transition from generating content to initiating real-world actions, a runtime execution reliability boundary becomes foundational infrastructure.
  </p>

  <p class="hero-subtitle hero-subtitle-tight">
    Built for high-liability workflows (healthcare, legal, finance, government): evidence is required to reach <strong>ALLOW</strong> for numeric, volatile, or high-impact assertions.

  <h2>Execution Reliability Is Not the Same as Security</h2>

  <p class="armor-highlight">
    <strong>Security protects what models see. TruCite protects what models do.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Confidential AI layers secure data and enforce policy boundaries. TruCite operates at a different
    control point — the moment before AI output triggers downstream action — issuing a
    machine-enforceable <strong>ALLOW / REVIEW / BLOCK</strong> decision based on evidence sufficiency
    and execution risk.
  </p>

  <p>
    In high-liability workflows, correctness before action is not optional infrastructure.

  <h2 class="section-title">Where TruCite Fits in the AI Stack</h2>

  <div class="bp-card bright-card">
    <h3>Upstream: AI Models & Agents</h3>
    <p>
      LLMs, RAG pipelines, and agent systems generate output intended for operational workflows.
    </p>

    <h3>TruCite: Runtime Execution Reliability Layer</h3>
    <p>
      TruCite evaluates structural integrity, uncertainty signals, and evidence presence — returning a 
      reliability score, a machine-enforceable decision, and an immutable audit fingerprint.
    </p>

    <h3>Downstream: Enterprise Execution Systems</h3>
    <p>
      Workflow orchestration, identity, and automation systems consume TruCite’s decision signal 
      before executing AI-driven actions.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      TruCite does not replace orchestration, governance, or security platforms — it provides the independent execution reliability signal those systems depend on.

    <div class="win-card bright-card">
      <h3>AI output becomes enterprise risk at the moment of action</h3>
      <p>
        The liability surface is not “generation” — it’s when AI output enters workflows, automation, customer delivery, clinical guidance, or legal reasoning.
        TruCite gates that transition.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="win-card bright-card">
      <h3>Retrieval + guardrails still don’t produce an enforceable decision</h3>
      <p>
        RAG can add sources and guardrails can restrict content — but enterprises still need a neutral runtime checkpoint that answers:
        <strong>“Is this output safe to act on?”</strong>

      <h3>TruCite emits the signal execution systems depend on</h3>
      <p>
        Orchestration, identity, authorization, and workflow systems can only enforce safe action if they receive a clear reliability decision.

      <p>
        TruCite is independent of agent frameworks and governance stacks. It does not orchestrate execution —

  </div>

  <div class="bp-card bright-card">
    <h3>2. Structural Reliability Analysis</h3>

  </div>

  <div class="bp-card bright-card">
    <h3>3. Policy-Based Decisioning</h3>

  </div>

  <div class="bp-card bright-card">
    <h3>4. Enforcement Signal + Audit Fingerprint</h3>

    <h3>Execution-Level Decisioning</h3>
    <p>
      Reliability is evaluated at the moment of action —
      not during prompt filtering or offline model evaluation.
    </p>

    <h3>Policy-Tuned Risk Signals</h3>
    <p>
      Modular signal libraries adapt to regulated environments

      Over time, TruCite builds a structured corpus of execution decisions,
      strengthening threshold calibration and policy enforcement.
    </p>

    <h3>Standardized Execution Audit Schema</h3>
    <p>
      TruCite defines a normalized, execution-bound audit schema —

      <h3>Language-Agnostic Risk Infrastructure</h3>
      <p>
        TruCite is designed as language-agnostic reliability infrastructure. While the MVP emphasizes

      <h3>Why This Matters in High-Liability Markets</h3>
      <p>
        In healthcare, legal, government, and financial workflows, critical decisions often occur in
        regional languages. TruCite supports global rollout by adding localized signal packs
        (confidence markers, hedging terms, domain-specific risk cues) while maintaining consistent

      <h3>Policy Gating Works Across Languages</h3>
      <p>
        Structural risk signals such as numeric claims, certainty patterns, and volatile real-world facts
        are evaluated independently of model vendor or language. This allows TruCite to apply consistent
        ALLOW / REVIEW / BLOCK policy decisions across global deployments.

      <details>
        <summary>What does the TruCite symbol mean?</summary>
        <div class="acc-body">
          The symbol is inspired in part by the Egyptian concept of <strong>Ma’at</strong> — truth and balance —
          where a feather is weighed against the heart. The golden feather represents <strong>truth</strong>,
          the blue orb represents <strong>signal</strong>, and the curved arc represents the
          <strong>verification layer</strong> weighing evidence before a score is rendered.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How is TruCite different from OpenEvidence?</summary>
        <div class="acc-body">
          OpenEvidence and similar tools focus on <strong>retrieval and citations</strong>.
          TruCite is a <strong>verification and policy layer</strong>: it scores the output itself and returns
          an enforceable gate action that downstream systems can use to control AI-driven workflows.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>If our data pipeline is secure and governed, why do we still need TruCite?</summary>
        <div class="acc-body">
          Secure data and governance ensure trusted inputs. But LLMs and agents transform that data into newly generated output,
          and that generation step introduces risk: hallucinated facts, overconfident language, misapplied guidelines, and
          reasoning errors — even with perfect source documents.
          <br /><br />
          TruCite covers the post-generation risk layer by scoring output reliability and issuing a machine-enforceable decision
          (ALLOW / REVIEW / BLOCK) plus an audit fingerprint for compliance, logging, and downstream enforcement.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
  <summary>Does TruCite handle execution governance or authorization?</summary>
  <div class="acc-body">
    TruCite focuses on output reliability and decision governance.
    It determines whether AI-generated output is safe to act on and returns
    a machine-enforceable decision signal.
    <br /><br />
    Execution governance — including identity binding, authorization, and workflow control —
    is handled by downstream orchestration or enterprise systems that consume TruCite’s decision output.
  </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Is this just “AI correcting AI”? Isn’t that risky?</summary>
        <div class="acc-body">
          TruCite does not replace your models or generate new content. It operates as an independent scoring and
          <strong>policy enforcement layer</strong> that supports human oversight and system-level safeguards.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How is TruCite future-proof if models keep changing?</summary>
        <div class="acc-body">
          TruCite is model-agnostic. It focuses on output integrity and risk signals rather than internal vendor confidence scores.
          This allows TruCite to function as a stable verification and enforcement layer even as underlying models evolve.
        </div>
      </details>

      <!-- NEW: Multilingual FAQ -->
      <details>
  <summary>Does TruCite support non-English or regional languages?</summary>
  <div class="acc-body">
    TruCite is designed as language-agnostic reliability infrastructure. The MVP demo emphasizes
    English-first signal analysis, while enterprise deployments extend verification through modular
    multilingual signal libraries tailored to regional and regulatory contexts.
    <br /><br />
    Structural risk signals — including numeric claims, certainty patterns, and volatile real-world facts —
    are evaluated independently of model vendor or language. This allows TruCite to apply consistent
    <strong>ALLOW / REVIEW / BLOCK</strong> policy decisions across global and regional-language AI deployments.
    <br /><br />
    Planned enterprise enhancements include multilingual evidence parsing, language-aware volatility detection,
    and country-specific policy profiles aligned with local compliance standards.
  </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Does TruCite store my content?</summary>
        <div class="acc-body">
          In this public MVP demo, no. Enterprise deployments can support encrypted audit trails under strict retention controls.
        </div>

  <!-- FOUNDER STORY -->

    <h2 class="section-title">Founder Story</h2>

    <div class="accordion">
      <details>
        <summary>Read story</summary>
        <div class="acc-body">
          TruCite was founded by <strong>Mani Subramanian, MD, MMI</strong> — physician executive,
          clinical informatics architect, and technology strategist — to solve a growing enterprise problem:
          AI systems can now generate guidance and decisions at scale, but organizations lack an
          independent layer to determine whether those outputs are safe to trust.
          <br /><br />
          After years leading clinical informatics transformation, EHR modernization, and
          technology-driven care redesign, Mani saw how small inaccuracies in high-stakes
          environments — healthcare, legal, financial — can cascade into real-world harm.
          <br /><br />
          TruCite was created to be that missing layer:
          <strong>independent AI output risk infrastructure</strong> that evaluates reliability,
          produces audit-ready risk signals, and issues a machine-enforceable decision
          (ALLOW / REVIEW / BLOCK) that enterprise systems can use to control AI-driven workflows.
          <br /><br />
          The vision is not to replace AI systems — but to make them deployable in
          environments where accountability, auditability, and safety are required.
