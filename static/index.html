  <div class="wins-grid">
    <div class="win-card bright-card">
      <h3>AI is producing decisions — without an accountability layer</h3>
      <p>
        Enterprises are deploying LLMs and agents into workflows where mistakes become liability.
        Most AI stacks still lack a neutral verification step that can score reliability and gate output.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="win-card bright-card">
      <h3>“Citations” are not verification</h3>
      <p>
        Retrieval can provide sources, but it doesn’t tell you whether the output is coherent,
        consistent, or aligned with the evidence provided. TruCite is a verification layer, not a chatbot.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="win-card bright-card">
      <h3>Reliability must be enforceable</h3>
      <p>
        TruCite returns a score + a Decision Gate (ALLOW / REVIEW / BLOCK) so unsafe output can be stopped
        before it reaches users, charts, contracts, or clinical decisions.

  <h2 class="section-title">Why Enterprises Will Require This</h2>
  <div class="wins-grid">

    <div class="win-card bright-card">
      <h3>AI systems are now making operational decisions</h3>
      <p>
        Enterprises are deploying LLMs and agents into workflows that impact
        customers, patients, financial outcomes, and legal exposure.
        These outputs increasingly function as system decisions — yet lack a formal accountability layer.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="win-card bright-card">
      <h3>Existing controls stop prompts — not outcomes</h3>
      <p>
        Guardrails and filters moderate inputs and responses, but they do not independently assess whether
        a generated output is reliable enough to act on. Enterprises need a decision checkpoint after generation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="win-card bright-card">
      <h3>Risk shifts from model behavior to downstream impact</h3>
      <p>
        The primary enterprise risk is no longer “what the model says,” but “what the system does with it.”
        Reliability scoring and policy gating are required before outputs reach automation pipelines or human decision-makers.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="win-card bright-card">
      <h3>Regulators expect auditable decision pathways</h3>
      <p>
        AI-generated decisions must become traceable. Enterprises need cryptographically anchored scoring,
        policy enforcement, and review signals to demonstrate responsible AI deployment.

  <h2 class="section-title">A Missing Layer in the AI Stack</h2>

  <div class="bp-card bright-card">
    <p>
      As AI systems become embedded into enterprise workflows, a new control layer
      is emerging between model output and system action. TruCite represents this category:
      independent reliability scoring and policy-based decision gating for AI-generated content.
    </p>
    <p>
      This layer does not replace models, guardrails, or monitoring systems —
      it governs whether AI output is sufficiently reliable to enter operational
      or automated pathways. Similar to how security evolved from firewalls to runtime enforcement,
      AI infrastructure now requires output-level control.
    </p>
    <p>
      TruCite is designed as a model-agnostic, API-first infrastructure component
      that integrates downstream of LLMs and agents, providing enterprise-grade scoring,
      ALLOW / REVIEW / BLOCK decisions, and audit-ready output fingerprints.

      <summary>What does the TruCite symbol mean?</summary>
      <div class="acc-body">
        The symbol is inspired in part by the Egyptian concept of <strong>Ma’at</strong> — truth and balance —
        where a feather is weighed against the heart. The golden feather represents <strong>truth</strong>,
        the blue orb represents <strong>signal</strong>, and the curved arc represents the
        <strong>verification layer</strong> weighing evidence before a score is rendered.

    <details>
      <summary>How is TruCite different from OpenEvidence?</summary>
      <div class="acc-body">
        OpenEvidence and similar tools focus on <strong>retrieval and citations</strong>.
        TruCite is a <strong>verification and policy layer</strong>: it scores the output itself and returns
        an enforceable gate action that downstream systems can use to control AI-driven workflows.

    <details>
      <summary>Is this just “AI correcting AI”? Isn’t that risky?</summary>
      <div class="acc-body">
        TruCite does not replace your models or generate new content. It operates as an independent scoring and

    <details>
      <summary>How is TruCite future-proof if models keep changing?</summary>
      <div class="acc-body">
        TruCite is model-agnostic. It focuses on output integrity and risk signals rather than internal vendor confidence scores.

  <div class="accordion">
    <details>
      <summary>Read story</summary>
      <div class="acc-body">
        TruCite was founded by <strong>Mani Subramanian, MD, MMI</strong> — physician executive,
        clinical informatics architect, and technology strategist — to solve a growing enterprise problem:
        AI systems can now generate guidance and decisions at scale, but organizations lack an
        independent layer to determine whether those outputs are safe to trust.

        <br /><br />
        After years leading clinical informatics transformation, EHR modernization, and
        technology-driven care redesign, Mani saw how small inaccuracies in high-stakes
        environments — healthcare, legal, financial — can cascade into real-world harm.

        <br /><br />
        TruCite was created to be that missing layer:
        <strong>independent AI output risk infrastructure</strong> that evaluates reliability,
        produces audit-ready risk signals, and issues a machine-enforceable decision
        (ALLOW / REVIEW / BLOCK) that enterprise systems can use to control AI-driven workflows.

        <br /><br />
        The vision is not to replace AI systems — but to make them deployable in
        environments where accountability, auditability, and safety are required.
