  <p class="hero-tagline">AI Output Risk Infrastructure &amp; Decision Gate</p>

  <p class="hero-subtitle">
    Identify AI risk signals before output becomes enterprise liability.
  </p>

  <p class="hero-subtitle hero-subtitle-tight">
    TruCite scores structural reliability, uncertainty signals, and risk patterns
    to produce audit-grade AI risk intelligence.
  </p>

  <p class="hero-missing-layer">
    TruCite is the missing risk intelligence layer between AI capability and enterprise trust.
  </p>

  <p class="hero-subtitle hero-subtitle-tight">
    Works alongside RAG and LLM systems to score output risk in real time.
  </p>

  <p class="hero-subtitle hero-subtitle-tight">
    Designed to integrate as a real-time policy and verification layer in AI-driven enterprise workflows.
  </p>

  <p class="hero-subtitle hero-subtitle-tight">
    TruCite detects volatile or time-sensitive claims and applies conservative policy gating unless evidence is present.
  </p>

  <p class="hero-subtitle hero-subtitle-tight">
    TruCite returns a Reliability Score, a machine-enforceable <strong>ALLOW / REVIEW / BLOCK</strong> decision,
    and an immutable cryptographic fingerprint of the evaluated output — so enterprises can audit what was approved, when, and under which policy.
  </p>

  <p class="hero-missing-layer">
    TruCite is the policy and reliability infrastructure enterprises will require as AI moves from experimentation to production.
  </p>

  <p class="hero-missing-layer">
    TruCite determines whether AI output is safe to trust — not just whether it has citations.

    <div class="win-card bright-card">
      <h3>Model Evals (Benchmarks)</h3>

    <div class="win-card bright-card">
      <h3>RAG / Retrieval</h3>
      <p>Improves grounding by fetching sources. But citations don’t guarantee the output is coherent, safe, or action-ready — and retrieval alone doesn’t gate what gets shipped.</p>

    <div class="win-card bright-card">
      <h3>Safety / Red-Teaming</h3>
      <p>Tests models for jailbreaks and harmful behaviors. Important — but mostly pre-deployment. Enterprises still need a runtime control layer when outputs hit real users and decisions.</p>

  <h2 class="section-title">FAQ's</h2>

  <div class="accordion">

    <details>
      <summary>What does the TruCite symbol mean?</summary>
      <div class="acc-body">
        The symbol is inspired in part by the Egyptian concept of <strong>Ma’at</strong> — truth and balance —
        where a feather is weighed against the heart. The golden feather represents <strong>truth</strong>,
        the blue orb represents <strong>signal</strong>, and the curved arc represents the
        <strong>verification layer</strong> weighing evidence before a score is rendered.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How is TruCite different from OpenEvidence?</summary>
      <div class="acc-body">
        OpenEvidence and similar tools focus on <strong>retrieval and citations</strong>.
        TruCite is a <strong>verification and policy layer</strong>: it scores the output itself and returns
        an enforceable gate action that downstream systems can use to control AI-driven workflows.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>If our data pipeline is secure and governed, why do we still need TruCite?</summary>
      <div class="acc-body">
        Secure data and governance ensure trusted inputs. But LLMs and agents transform that data into newly generated output,
        and that generation step introduces risk: hallucinated facts, overconfident language, misapplied guidelines, and
        reasoning errors — even with perfect source documents.
        <br /><br />
        TruCite covers the post-generation risk layer by scoring output reliability and issuing a machine-enforceable decision
        (ALLOW / REVIEW / BLOCK) plus an audit fingerprint for compliance, logging, and downstream enforcement.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Is this just “AI correcting AI”? Isn’t that risky?</summary>
      <div class="acc-body">
        TruCite does not replace your models or generate new content. It operates as an independent scoring and
        <strong>policy enforcement layer</strong> that supports human oversight and system-level safeguards.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How is TruCite future-proof if models keep changing?</summary>
      <div class="acc-body">
        TruCite is model-agnostic. It focuses on output integrity and risk signals rather than internal vendor confidence scores.
        This allows TruCite to function as a stable verification and enforcement layer even as underlying models evolve.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Does TruCite support non-English or regional languages?</summary>
      <div class="acc-body">
        TruCite is designed as language-agnostic risk infrastructure. Early deployments emphasize English-first signal analysis,
        with multilingual expansion planned for global enterprise workflows.
        <br /><br />
        Even in multilingual scenarios, TruCite’s policy gating remains consistent. Structural risk signals,
        certainty vs uncertainty patterns, numeric claim handling, and volatility detection are evaluated
        independent of model vendor or language.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Does TruCite store my content?</summary>
      <div class="acc-body">
        In this public MVP demo, no. Enterprise deployments can support encrypted audit trails under strict retention controls.

  <h2 class="section-title">Founder Story</h2>

  <div class="accordion">
    <details>
      <summary>Read story</summary>
      <div class="acc-body">
        TruCite was founded by <strong>Mani Subramanian, MD, MMI</strong> — physician executive,
        clinical informatics architect, and technology strategist — to solve a growing enterprise problem:
        AI systems can now generate guidance and decisions at scale, but organizations lack an
        independent layer to determine whether those outputs are safe to trust.

        <br /><br />
        After years leading clinical informatics transformation, EHR modernization, and
        technology-driven care redesign, Mani saw how small inaccuracies in high-stakes
        environments — healthcare, legal, financial — can cascade into real-world harm.

        <br /><br />
        TruCite was created to be that missing layer:
        <strong>independent AI output risk infrastructure</strong> that evaluates reliability,
        produces audit-ready risk signals, and issues a machine-enforceable decision
        (ALLOW / REVIEW / BLOCK) that enterprise systems can use to control AI-driven workflows.

        <br /><br />
        The vision is not to replace AI systems — but to make them deployable in
        environments where accountability, auditability, and safety are required.
