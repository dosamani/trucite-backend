      Audit-Grade AI Verification for High-Liability Workflows
    </p>

    <p class="hero-subtitle">
      Detect fabricated citations, hallucinated facts, and misalignment risk — before AI output becomes liability.
    </p>

    <p class="hero-subtitle">
      TruCite is the independent verification <strong>decision layer</strong> between AI capability and AI reliability.
      It evaluates output integrity, internal consistency, uncertainty signals, and drift risk — producing a reliability
      score, a clear verdict (<strong>approve / flag / defer</strong>), and an audit trail.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>First wedge:</strong> legal research &amp; writing — where fabricated citations can trigger sanctions, malpractice exposure, and reputational damage.
      Built for law, healthcare, finance, and other high-liability domains where AI mistakes carry real consequences.
    </p>

    <p class="hero-missing-layer">
      Reliability is a decision — not a guess.
    </p>

    <p class="hero-subtitle hero-subtitle-tight">
      Retrieval can show where an answer <em>might</em> have come from. TruCite decides whether the output is safe to rely on —
      then logs an audit-ready record.

      <div class="wins-grid">
        <div class="win-card bright-card">
          <h3>Independent Verification Decision Layer</h3>
          <p>
            TruCite evaluates AI output for reliability and risk before it is used in real-world decisions — helping prevent
            fabricated citations, hallucinated facts, and hidden failure modes from becoming legal, financial, or operational liabilities.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="win-card bright-card">
          <h3>Model &amp; Architecture Agnostic</h3>
          <p>
            TruCite works across LLMs, agents, retrieval systems, and emerging AI architectures. It does not rely on
            vendor-provided confidence scores or internal model signals — enabling neutral, consistent, auditable assessment.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="win-card bright-card">
          <h3>Built for Drift &amp; Compliance</h3>
          <p>
            TruCite can monitor behavioral drift, uncertainty signals, and reliability decay over time, generating
            audit-ready evidence for high-liability environments such as law, healthcare, finance, and enterprise risk.
          </p>

        <div class="win-card bright-card">
          <h3>Path to “Truth OS” via Verifiable Decisions</h3>
          <p>
            As AI systems scale across organizations, TruCite becomes the persistent verification layer that keeps AI output
            defensible and auditable — regardless of how underlying models evolve.

    <!-- FAQ's -->
    <section id="faq" class="faq-section">
      <h2 class="section-title">FAQ's</h2>

      <div class="accordion">
        <details>
          <summary>What does the TruCite symbol mean?</summary>
          <div class="acc-body">
            The symbol is inspired in part by the Egyptian concept of <strong>Ma’at</strong> — truth and balance —
            where a feather is weighed against the heart. The golden feather represents <strong>truth</strong>, the
            blue orb represents <strong>signal</strong> being evaluated, and the curved arc represents the
            <strong>verification layer</strong> weighing evidence before a score is rendered.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>How is TruCite different from OpenEvidence?</summary>
          <div class="acc-body">
            OpenEvidence (and similar tools) primarily focus on <strong>retrieval and citations</strong> — surfacing
            sources to support an answer. TruCite is a <strong>verification decision layer</strong>: we evaluate the
            <strong>output itself</strong> for reliability (structure, internal consistency, uncertainty signals,
            drift risk) and return an audit-grade verdict.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Is this just “AI correcting AI”? Isn’t that risky?</summary>
          <div class="acc-body">
            TruCite does not replace your models or generate new content. It operates as an independent verification
            layer that evaluates AI outputs using structural integrity, uncertainty signals, and known risk patterns,
            and produces a human-reviewable explanation and audit trail.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>How is TruCite future-proof if models keep changing?</summary>
          <div class="acc-body">
            TruCite is model-agnostic. It analyzes properties of the output itself — coherence, structure, specificity,
            uncertainty cues, and drift vs historical outputs — rather than relying on any one vendor’s internal confidence signal.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Can TruCite detect model drift or silent behavior changes?</summary>
          <div class="acc-body">
            Yes — in enterprise mode. TruCite can track outputs over time for the same prompt or workflow and flag when
            a model upgrade or prompt change causes behavior to diverge.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What exactly is a “truth score”?</summary>
          <div class="acc-body">
            The score is a composite reliability indicator — not a magical oracle. It blends structural features (numerics,
            references, internal consistency), uncertainty signals, and known false-pattern heuristics to support a clear verdict.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Why now? Haven’t we had fact-checking for years?</summary>
          <div class="acc-body">
            Traditional fact-checking was built for human-written content in slow cycles. AI changes the tempo: millions of
            outputs across multiple models, updated frequently, embedded in agents and workflows. Verification must become a system.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Why didn’t the big players build this themselves?</summary>
          <div class="acc-body">
            Most platforms optimize for speed and scale. TruCite starts from the opposite direction:
            verification-first decisioning with auditability.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Who is TruCite for?</summary>
          <div class="acc-body">
            Teams deploying AI copilots or agents into production; institutions in legal, healthcare, finance, and
            compliance who need auditability; and AI vendors who want an independent verification layer.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Does TruCite store my content?</summary>
          <div class="acc-body">
            In this public demo, no. In enterprise deployments, TruCite can store encrypted audit trails under strict
            retention and access policies.

            TruCite was founded by <strong>Mani Subramanian, MD, MMI</strong> —
            physician executive, clinical informatics architect, and technology strategist —
            to solve a growing problem: AI now generates decisions, content, and guidance,

            <br /><br />
            TruCite is not a chatbot or a generic fact-checker; it is a verification decision layer — a system that measures output integrity,
            uncertainty patterns, drift risk, and contextual grounding so machine-generated output can be audited,
