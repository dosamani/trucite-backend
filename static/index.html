      <h2 class="section-title">Why TruCite Wins</h2>
      <div class="wins-grid">
        <div class="win-card bright-card">
          <h3>Independent Verification Layer</h3>
          <p>
            TruCite independently evaluates AI output for reliability, grounding, and risk before it is used in real-world decisions —
            preventing hallucinated facts, fabricated citations, and hidden model failures from becoming legal, financial, or operational liabilities.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="win-card bright-card">
          <h3>Model &amp; Architecture Agnostic</h3>
          <p>
            TruCite works across LLMs, agents, retrieval systems, and emerging AI architectures. It does not rely on vendor-provided confidence scores
            or internal model signals — ensuring neutral, consistent, and auditable reliability assessment.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="win-card bright-card">
          <h3>Built for Drift &amp; Compliance</h3>
          <p>
            TruCite continuously monitors behavioral drift, uncertainty signals, and reliability decay over time, generating audit-ready evidence
            for regulated environments such as law, healthcare, finance, and enterprise risk management.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="win-card bright-card">
          <h3>Future-Proof “Truth OS”</h3>
          <p>
            As AI systems scale across organizations and decision-making pipelines, TruCite becomes the persistent verification layer that keeps AI output
            reliable, defensible, and compliant — regardless of how underlying models evolve.

    <!-- FAQ's -->
    <section id="faq" class="faq-section">
      <h2 class="section-title">FAQ's</h2>

      <div class="accordion">
        <details>
          <summary>What does the TruCite symbol mean?</summary>
          <div class="acc-body">
            The symbol is inspired in part by the Egyptian concept of <strong>Ma’at</strong> — truth and balance —
            where a feather is weighed against the heart. The golden feather represents <strong>truth</strong>, the
            blue orb represents <strong>signal</strong> being evaluated, and the curved arc represents the
            <strong>verification layer</strong> weighing evidence before a truth score is rendered.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>How is TruCite different from OpenEvidence?</summary>
          <div class="acc-body">
            OpenEvidence (and similar tools) primarily focus on <strong>retrieval and citations</strong> — surfacing
            sources to support an answer. TruCite is a <strong>verification layer</strong>: we score the
            <strong>output itself</strong> for reliability (structure, internal consistency, uncertainty signals,
            drift risk) and return an audit-grade verdict.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Is this just “AI correcting AI”? Isn’t that risky?</summary>
          <div class="acc-body">
            TruCite does not replace your models or generate new content. It operates as an independent verification
            layer that scores AI outputs using structural integrity, uncertainty language, and known risk patterns.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>How is TruCite future-proof if models keep changing?</summary>
          <div class="acc-body">
            We are model-agnostic. TruCite analyzes properties of the output itself — coherence, structure, specificity,
            patterns, drift vs historical outputs — rather than relying on one vendor’s internal confidence signal.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Can TruCite detect model drift or silent behavior changes?</summary>
          <div class="acc-body">
            Yes — in enterprise mode. TruCite can track outputs over time for the same prompt or workflow and flag when
            a model upgrade or prompt change causes behavior to diverge.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What exactly is a “truth score”?</summary>
          <div class="acc-body">
            The truth score is a composite indicator — not a magical oracle. It blends structural features (numerics,
            references, internal consistency), linguistic uncertainty and hallucination signals, and known
            false-pattern heuristics.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Why now? Haven’t we had fact-checking for years?</summary>
          <div class="acc-body">
            Traditional fact-checking was built for human-written news in a slow cycle. AI changes the tempo: millions of
            outputs across multiple models, updated weekly, embedded in agents and workflows.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Why didn’t the big players build this themselves?</summary>
          <div class="acc-body">
            Big tech optimized for speed, scale, and engagement — not auditability. TruCite starts from the opposite direction:
            verification-first.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Who is TruCite for?</summary>
          <div class="acc-body">
            Teams deploying AI copilots or agents into production; institutions in legal, healthcare, finance, and
            compliance who need auditability; and AI vendors who want an independent verification layer.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Does TruCite store my content?</summary>
          <div class="acc-body">
            In this public demo, no. In enterprise deployments, TruCite can store encrypted audit trails under strict
            retention and access policies.

            TruCite was founded by <strong>Mani Subramanian, MD, MMI</strong> —
            physician executive, clinical informatics architect, and technology strategist —
            to solve a growing problem: AI now generates decisions, content, and guidance,
            but offers no accountability for correctness.

            TruCite is not a chatbot or a fact-checker; it is a verification layer — a system that measures signal integrity,
            structured reasoning, uncertainty patterns, and contextual grounding so machine-generated output can be audited,
